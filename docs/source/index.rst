About Cal-Adapt
==================

Cal-Adapt has been designed to provide access to the wealth of data and information that has been, and continues to be, produced by State of California's scientific and research community. The data available on this site offer 
a view of how climate change might affect California at the local level. Here you can work with visualization tools, access data, and participate in community sharing to contribute your own knowledge. Cal-Adapts development was a key recommendation of the 2009 California Climate Adaptation Strategy.

The API is developed by `Geospatial Innovation Facility (GIF), UC Berkeley <http://gif.berkeley.edu/>`_ with funding and advisory oversight by `California Energy Commission <http://www.energy.ca.gov/>`_.


About the API
==================

Cal-Adapt API is a Open or Public API and provides programmatic access to data hosted by Cal-Adapt through an Application Programming Interface (API). The API is powered by Django, Django REST framework, and `Django-Spillway <https://github.com/bkg/django-spillway>`_, an open source library developed at the GIF. Cal-Adapt API is a self-documenting API that will return data in GeoTIFF, GeoJSON, CSV and other data formats.

Currently the Cal-Adapt API does not require authentication. You do not need to sign up for a key to start working with the API. We plan to maintain the current level of open access to support a wide range of users. However, authentication may be implemented in the future to support throttled access for selected applications.
